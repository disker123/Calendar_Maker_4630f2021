Chose to make a PWA that parses the table for the Umass Lowell 
academic calendar and automaticallyparses it for monday class 
schedule days and days off.

Built as a PWA for device compatibility and lightweight install.
Chose to parse the calendar from the website rather than manually
entering the data by hand. This requires internet on first launch
but makes updating the app easier.

Used the local storage on the user's device rather than a database.

Could have been built as a native app but chose to make a PWA for
compatibility reasons and familiarity with the languages used.
